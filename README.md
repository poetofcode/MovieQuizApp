# MovieQuizApp for Android

Test your knowledge of horror movies with MovieQuizApp! I made this app as a size project because I am a real fan of this genre of cinema.

The basic idea is to turn the movie information file movie.json into a mobile quiz application. The application is written using Kotlin and is compatible with Android OS 4.4+ (KitKat and higher).
